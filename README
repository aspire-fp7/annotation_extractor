1) Purpose

	This program is the annotation reader. It is intended to extract ASPIRE 
	annotations from source files, to be used in the bin2bin ACTC. 
	
	Annotations are stored in json format.

2) Directory content

	readAnnot.sh : the script to run to extract annotations
	convert_pragmas.py : python component to do some preprocessing
	readAnnot.x : Txl component to extract annotations
	README : this documentation file


3) Preconditions

	The source file should be already preprocessed (gcc -E) and normalized.
	In particular, this program expects variable definitions to contain 
	only a single variable. 

	For example this syntax is not allowed:
		int a, b;
	
	They should be already normalized into:
		int a;
		int b;

4) Usage
	Run the program like this:
		readAnnot.sh INPUTFILE.i OUTPUTFILE.json
	
	The syntax of the generated json file is explained in D5.01(b).
